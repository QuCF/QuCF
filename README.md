QuCF uses a slightly modified version of the [QuEST toolkit](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST).
- Instructions for installing the code are available [here](https://github.com/QuCF/QuCF/wiki/Installing).
- Instructions for computing the QSVT angles are available [here](https://github.com/QuCF/QuCF/wiki/Computing-QSVT-angles).
- Instructions for computing the QSP angles (for fully-coherent Hamiltonian simulations) are available [here](https://github.com/QuCF/QuCF/wiki/QSP%E2%80%90Ham%E2%80%90angles).
