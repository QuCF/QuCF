QuCF uses a slightly modified version of the [QuEST toolkit](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST).

To compile QuCF, create a folder [QuCF]:
- cd [QuCF] 
- git clone git@github.com:QuCF/QuCF.git
- cd QuCF/build_qucf
- source tobuild
- make

REMARK: you might need to correct the `-DGPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY` in the `tobuild` files according to your GPU device
(https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute).

For post-processing QuCF simulations, one also needs [https://github.com/QuCF/scripts-py]:
    - cd [QuCF]
    - git clone https://github.com/QuCF/scripts-py/tree/main
Hence, [QuCF]/scripts-py will contain .py files for post-processing simulations from [QuCF]/QuCF.
